Sepsis, a life-threatening condition, can lead to organ failure and mortality if not detected and treated promptly. Therefore, early sepsis detection is crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. This research project concentrates on the application of feature selection techniques, including Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), a wrapper method, as well as Principal Component Analysis(PCA), and Kernel PCA, which belong to dimensionality reduction. The primary objective is to employ the Random Forest model for early sepsis prediction, using a publicly available dataset comprising clinical data from sepsis-diagnosed patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The dataset undergoes preprocessing to extract pertinent features, facilitating the Random Forest model training. We evaluate the performance of these feature selection techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). The study aims to unveil the most effective feature selection strategy within the Random Forest model for early sepsis detection. The results offer valuable insights to clinicians, enabling them to make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes by identifying sepsis before it reaches critical stages.
